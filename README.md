Filling the four arrays with different lenghts each by try catch block.

The task of this program is to return an array of char type with symbols from the ASCII table from the exclamation point symbol to the tilde symbol, omitting the characters from 0 to 9 and the alphabet with upper and lower case letters.
The first step of the task was to create four arrays of type Integer, each with a different length. The longest array(with symbols with values 33 to 47 from the ASCII array) was filled first. 
To fill next arrays, an exception had to be used. Using a try catch block, it was possible to fill successive arrays, each of which had a length less than the previous one.
