# Filling the four arrays with different lenghts each by try-catch block</bold>

The task of this program is to return an array of char type with symbols from the ASCII table from the exclamation point symbol (!) to the tilde symbol(~), omitting the characters from 0 to 9 and the alphabet with upper and lower case letters.
The first step of the task was to create four arrays of type Integer, each with a different length. 
The longest array(with symbols with values 33 to 47 from the ASCII array) was filled first. 
To fill next arrays, an exception had to be used. Using a try-catch block, it was possible to fill successive arrays, each of which had a length less than the previous one.
